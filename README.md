# Imaging Processing Scripts
Some scripts for processing (mostly) biomedical images.

These scripts are mostly provided as a reference for any interested individual, when trying to perform some similar function.

It is not expected that these scripts will be well supported. Treat them mostly as a reference if you want to perform something like this.


#### Contents

- C++ script for conversion of .mha to .nii or .nii.gz files. At ./typeConversion/mhaToNii
- ... more to come ..?

#### Support

No support can be provided for these scripts, sorry for this. You are advised to simply treat them as a reference in case you want to perform something similar and don't know how.
